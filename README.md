# Interpreter
An interpreter written in python that includes my own programming language
This project has been going on since 5/12/23 and im very happy with the result until now

# Usage
To use this interpreter you need to have python installed on your computer but you dont need any modules

# Features
maths, print, vars

# The usage of maths is like this:
5 + 5
-----
5 - 5
-----
5 * 5
-----
5 / 5
-----
x + y
-----
etc.

# The usage of the print functions can be used like this:
print("Hello World!")
-----
name = "zigouris"

print(name)
-----

# The usage of adding strings can be used like this:
first = "Super"
-----
second = "man"
-----
print(first + second)
-----

# The usage of creating variables:
var = value
-----
the current values that exist are strings, integers, floats and the code is under maintance for booleans, lists, dictionaries and functions too.
-----
to print the var you can use the print func like this: print(var)
