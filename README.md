# Interpreter
An interpreter written in python that includes my own programming language
This project has been going for around 2 days and im very happy with the result until now

# Usage

To use this interpreter you need to have python installed on your computer but you dont need any modules

# Features
maths, print, vars

# The usage of maths is like this:
5 + 5
5 - 5
5 * 5
5 / 5
or
x + y
etc.

# The usage of the print functions can be used like this:
print("Hello World!")
or like this
name = "zigouris"
print(name)

# The usage of adding strings can be used like this:
first = "Super"
second = "man"
print(first + second)

# The usage of creating variables:
var = value
the current values that exist are strings, integers, floats available and the code is under maintance for booleans, lists, dictionaries and functions too.
to print the var you can use the print func like this: print(var)

# About me
My name is thanos and im 14 years old, python is my fav language cause i've been coding in that language since i was 10 years old.
My inspiration and motivation for this project was by a friend named An0nSaiko on github you can check his profile below, and i want to continue it and finish it by early september and make it a whole programming language, if this happens until then im gonna be very happy with the results and myself for doing something so hard for first time. 
I've coded in c, c++, java, some more languages in the past.
