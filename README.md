# Interpreter
An interpreter written in python that includes my own programming language
This project has been going on since  10th July 2023 and im very happy with the result until now

# Usage
To use this interpreter you need to have python installed on your computer but you dont need any modules

# Features
maths, print, vars

# The usage of maths is like this:
5 + 5
-----
5 - 5
-----
5 * 5
-----
5 / 5
-----
x + y
-----
etc.

# You can use the print function like this:
print("Hello World!")
-----
name = "zigouris"

print(name)
-----

# The usage of adding strings can be used like this:
first = "Super"
-----
second = "man"
-----
print(first + second)
-----

# The usage of creating variables:
var = value
-----
the current values that exist are strings, integers, floats and the code is under maintance for booleans, lists, dictionaries and functions too.
-----
to print the var you can use the print func like this: print(var)
